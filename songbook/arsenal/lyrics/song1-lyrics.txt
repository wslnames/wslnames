To the Tune of Twist and Shout – The Beatles

Aaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaahhhh Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Shake it Caldentey now
(Shake it Caldentey)
Twist and shout 
(twist and shout)
Come on come on Caldentey now 
(come on Caldentey)
Work it on out

You know you twist so good,
(Twist so good),
You know you twist so fine, 
(Twist so fine)
Come on come on come on Caldentey now

And let me know that you’re mine 
(Let me know you’re mine)
